Deal Fortress is a full-stack web application 
full pair programmed (until january 2024) by [Luc Siat](https://github.com/Luc-Siat) and [Atte Pitk√§nen](https://github.com/attepitkaenen)

  Checkout the app [here](https://green-sand-04a2d9f03.3.azurestaticapps.net/) (Please note that there is a cold start on the DB, give it 20 seconds on the first launch)

### Pitch

DealFortress aims to bridge the gap between the UI of first hand and the concept of second hand. 
  - We do not want people to spend hours reading ad description hoping to find what they want. Here they will be able to utilize the filters and the DB separation of the ad and the different products. This means they can filter to get this product at this price.
  - We want to leverage the community to flag scams and rate sellers. Here they will have a dedicated website with a reputation system, this solves the scam issue that bigger platforms like Tradera or Facebook Market might be facing. And who knows maybe one day we will have BankID?
